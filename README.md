# Pneumonia Diagnosis Refinement using Enhanced Lung Segmentation

• Developed an image processing pipeline for lung segmentation in
chest X-rays, aiding in the detection of lung diseases like
Pneumonia.
• Crop labels, cluster for edge detection and lung segmentation,
refine with contour detection, then save as binary images
• Noticeably, accuracy rose by 9%, from 72% to 81%, showcasing
significant improvement
