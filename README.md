# Pneumonia Diagnosis Refinement using Enhanced Lung Segmentation

* Developed an image processing pipeline for lung segmentation in chest X-rays, aiding in the detection of lung diseases like Pneumonia.
* Crop labels, cluster for edge detection and lung segmentation, refine with contour detection, then save as binary images Noticeably, accuracy rose by 9%, from 72% to 81%, showcasing significant improvement
* Skills Developed: Python, Image Processing, Machine Learning Pneumonia Diagnosis Refinement using Enhanced Lung Segmentation
